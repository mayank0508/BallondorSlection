# BallondorSlection
This  a simple C++ program to select players for ballondor contension
This program's main goal is to check wheather a  player is eligible for winning a ballondor
or not there are 2 conditions here, if a certain player satisfies the conditions he can win the ballon dor.

This is just in a demo state, i have to work on it, in the coming days !! it can be moulded into a tidy small program .
